### Hey, I'm Santiago 👋

Senior Python Developer focused on tools & pipelines for games, VFX, and content creators.

I build frameworks, DCC tools, and internal platforms that make creative chaos disappear — the kind of glue code that keeps productions moving without blowing up. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🎨 What I Do

- 🛠 **Tools & Pipelines for Games / VFX**
  - Python/C++ tools and plugins for Maya, Houdini, Unreal, Blender, DaVinci.
  - Scene inspection, ingest/publish workflows, logging/monitoring, environment management. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- 🧰 **Internal Platforms & DevEx**
  - CLIs, SDKs, and internal APIs for other teams.
  - CI/CD, observability, and automation around rendering, assets, and ops.

- 🎮 **Content & Game-Adjacent Automation**
  - Capture orchestration (OBS + games), manifest-driven sessions.
  - Asset organization, notifications, and small game experiments.

## 🔭 Currently working on
- 👨‍💻 **Senior Python Developer / DCC Team Lead @ [ICVIR](https://icvr.io/)**  
  Cross-DCC plugin frameworks, scene inspectors, ingest tools, and Rez-based environment workflows for Houdini, Maya, Unreal, Blender, and DaVinci. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

- 🧪 **Building [Trivox](https://github.com/trivox-io) – Content Pipeline Conductor (Personal R&D)**  
  Modular Python framework for orchestrating gameplay capture, manifest-driven sessions, and asset organization for solo creators and small teams.

- 🎯 **Bridging deeper into game dev**  
  Using my tooling/pipeline background to move closer to real game production (C++/Unreal, gameplay systems, and better tools for devs & artists).
